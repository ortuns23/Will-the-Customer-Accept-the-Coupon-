# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon

## Overview
In this first practical application assignment of the program, the goal is to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The project utilizes visualizations and probability distributions to differentiate between customers who accepted a driving coupon and those who did not. Refer to the Practical Application 1 Jupyter Notebook to complete this assignment.

## Data
The data for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey presents various driving scenarios, including destination, current time, weather, presence of passengers, etc. Participants were asked whether they would accept the coupon if they are the driver. Responses indicating willingness to drive "right away" or "later before the coupon expires" are labeled as “Y = 1”, while responses indicating "no, I do not want the coupon" are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five types of coupons: less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

## Usage
The primary analysis and code for this project are available in the Jupyter Notebook provided in the Practical Application 1 Jupyter Notebook. The notebook covers data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling to identify factors influencing customer acceptance of coupons.

## Dependencies
Ensure Python is installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
